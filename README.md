# RC1Computer
8-Bit Relay Computer inspired by Harry Porter and DipDot
# General Information
This Computer, inspired Harry H Porter III, Ph.D, Paul Law, and Youtuber DipDot, is (almost) completly made out of relays, 607 of them to be exact.
# Specifications
- 32 kb RAM
- It has 11 8 Bit Registers. Some of them can also funtcion as 16 Bit Registers.
- A clock rate Between 3 and 8 Hertz

# Future features
- I want to make some sort Storage medium. A Tape interface, similar to DipDot's design, would be nice, although for a computer like that kind of lame in my opinion. I am thinking more like a paper based interface, like the one Usagi electric build for the [UE1](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLnw98JPyObn0v-98gRV9PfzAQONTKxql3). One Slight Problem thogh: _Reading_ may be somewhat easy, the _writing_ on the hand may be a little challenge... We'll burn that bridge when we get there.
- The Second thing i want to make for this project is some sort of Serial/ Terminal output. That itself is not that hard all things considered, it's nearly a chip solution. The real problem is that the Computer most likely lacks any sort of speed for that kind of outpu. So i either have to buffer the output, make it _exceptionaly_ slow, or find some other way of sending a serial signal of of the Computer.
